# Mastercard Forage Job Simulation

## Objective

This project involves analyzing phishing threats, identifying attack patterns, and designing security awareness training materials as part of the Mastercard Cybersecurity Simulation.

### Scenario
Analyst on Mastercard Security Awareness Team.

Our Chief Security Officer (CSO) relies on our team to help our staff learn how to identify and report security threats to Mastercard.

At Mastercard, one of the ways we mitigate phishing threats is by educating our people about the risks and how to identify them. An effective way to build awareness is through phishing simulation campaigns:

We test our staff every month by sending a fake phishing email that is made to look like something a bad actor would send.
We use the results of the simulated test to help us design and implement future training.

### Skills Learned



### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
