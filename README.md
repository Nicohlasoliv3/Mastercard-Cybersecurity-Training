# Mastercard Forage Job Simulation

## Objective

This project involves analyzing phishing threats, identifying attack patterns, and designing security awareness training materials as part of the Mastercard Cybersecurity Simulation.

### Scenario
Analyst on Mastercard Security Awareness Team.

Our Chief Security Officer (CSO) relies on our team to help our staff learn how to identify and report security threats to Mastercard.

At Mastercard, one of the ways we mitigate phishing threats is by educating our people about the risks and how to identify them. An effective way to build awareness is through phishing simulation campaigns:

We test our staff every month by sending a fake phishing email that is made to look like something a bad actor would send.
We use the results of the simulated test to help us design and implement future training.

### Skills Learned



### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.

## Task

# Key Diffrences Betwwen Emails 
Both phishing emails are designed to trick the recipient into clicking a malicious link and providing their login credentials, but they have key differences in their approach and execution.

## Differences in Tactics:
Sense of Urgency & Fear Tactics:
Email 1 (mastercardsIT@gmail.com): Uses strong urgency and fear by claiming the account has been compromised and must be reset within an hour to avoid being locked.
Email 2 (Mastercard.ITsupport@gmail.com): Takes a more investigative approach, suggesting that suspicious activity has been detected and asking the recipient to confirm whether it was them.
## Grammar & Spelling Issues:
Email 1: Minor issues, such as missing spaces ("Regards,Mastercard IT.") and lack of proper formatting.
Email 2: Contains multiple grammatical errors and awkward phrasing (e.g., "Were asking that if these events are being created by you or if there are not." and "utilizes the link bellow"). These mistakes make it more obvious as a phishing attempt.
## Email Address Structure:
Email 1: Uses "mastercardsIT@gmail.com," which is suspicious because an official Mastercard IT team would not use a generic Gmail address.
Email 2: Uses "Mastercard.ITsupport@gmail.com," which is still an untrusted domain but tries to appear more legitimate.
## Phishing Link Format:
Email 1: Links to Wikipedia's phishing article (which is harmless, likely an example instead of an actual attack).
Email 2: Uses a deceptive URL structure (e.g., "Https://Masterfix.com/password/account/restore"). Attackers often use domains that resemble legitimate ones but with subtle misspellings or extra words.

## Step 2: Interpet phishing simulation results
Overview:
identify which areas of the business need more awareness about phishing, and
design and implement the appropriate training for those teams to lower our risk of an attack.

## Task 1: Discover Which teams performed poorly in the phishing simulation
HR & Marketing Teams
## Task 2: create a short presentation  providing some awareness and training materials for the two teams that appear to be most susceptible. This will help us improve the security awareness of the teams that performed poorly in this campaign.
